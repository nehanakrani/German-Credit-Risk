## **Detecting and Mitigating Age Bias on Credit Decisions Using a Hybrid Model for Loan Repayment Prediction**

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
`Credit Risk Analysis`
- Credit Risk is the probable risk of loss resulting from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations. If a company offers credit to its client,then there is a risk that its clients may not pay their invoices.

`Types of Credit Risk`
- Good Risk: An investment that one believes is likely to be profitable. The term most often refers to a loan made to a creditworthy person or company. Good risks are considered exceptionally likely to be repaid.
- Bad Risk: A loan that is unlikely to be repaid because of bad credit history, insufficient income, or some other reason. A bad risk increases the risk to the lender and the likelihood of default on the part of the borrower.

`Dataset Description:`
- The dataset contains 1000 entries with 20 independent variables (7 numerical, 13 categorical) and 1 target variable prepared by Prof. Hofmann. In this dataset, each entry represents a person who takes a credit by a bank. Each person is classified as good or bad credit risks according to the set of attributes.
